The Odin Project
================

This is my solution for the [Rails Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/ruby-on-rails?ref=lnav).

To create the app I preferred using rspec rather than Test::Unit, so instead of creating with `rails new blogger`
I did the steps below to get the project started with RSpec:

	1. `$ rails new blogger -T`
	2. `gem 'rspec-rails' #added to Gemfile`
	3. `$ bundle install`
	4. `$ rails generate rspec:install`
